# Announcement of Course Project

Each group needs to select one topic from academic journals or conferences (CCF-A or B:[ ](https://www.ccf.org.cn/Academic_Evaluation/By_category))https://www.ccf.org.cn/Academic_Evaluation/By_category). The paper you choose should be **relevant** to the course content, but the algorithm examples in the textbook and slides cannot be regarded as your topic. It should solve a problem in a specific domain.



You are free to establish the team with **up to 5 team members**. Feel free to use the Piazza “search for teammates” function.

Here are some important scheduled times you need to follow:

1. **April 30th**: form groups
   Submit your group info in the following online sheet: https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DZUtDZmVOcmRLUWRz?tab=BB08J2
2. **May 6th**: proposal submission due
   Submit your topic in the same online sheet as above.
3. **June 5th** (Thursday, Week 16)
    Course time: final presentation
    11:59 pm: report submission due

For the final submission, the following materials are required:

1. The original paper.
2. Program source code, focusing on the algorithm part of the paper.
3. An executable program or demo video.
4. The experimental report should include, but not be limited to:
   1. Analysis of the correctness of the algorithm.
   2. Formal description of the algorithm (pseudo code).
   3. Complexity analysis of the algorithm.
   4. Program running environment and running results.
   5. Consideration and improvement of the algorithm in the paper.
   6. The division of labor in your team.

If you use the open-source code provided by the paper, you should explicitly indicate your contribution and improvement.

Please submit your zipped file with the name"CS240_[Your group ID]_[group leader FULL NAME]" to https://epan.shanghaitech.edu.cn/l/qFDuAZ
