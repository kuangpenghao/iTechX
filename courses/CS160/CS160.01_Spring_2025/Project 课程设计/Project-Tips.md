# Tips for the Course Project Opening Presentation - 20250409

Dear all,



The course project typically follows a structured procedure, aligning with the stages outlined in class:

 

1. Introduction, Related Work, and Needs Finding
2. Points of View (POVs), How Might We (HMW) Statements, and Experience Prototypes
3. Concept Video
4. Low-fidelity Prototype/Medium-fidelity Prototype
5. Group Heuristic Evaluation
6. High-fidelity Prototype
7. Implementation
8. Evaluation
9. Reflection/Labor Division



During the project opening, groups are expected to cover stages 1 and 2, and optionally stage 3. However, for the final presentation, all stages from 1 to 9 should be addressed. Each team must present their project at the end of the course, reflecting on their design process across key stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, implement, and evaluate. While implementation is required, it contributes only a small portion to the final score. Teams are not required to have a fully implemented system but should provide a playable demo to facilitate later evaluation. All team members should participate in the presentation, although not necessarily all will present. The duration of the project opening presentation is limited to 10 minutes.



Get prepared for the course project opening presentation on 9th, April.



Best,
