# One Method of Paper Reading

To understand state-of-the-art results, it is important to read and parse research papers. If this is your first time reading a research paper, this guide may be helpful.

This resource may be even useful for veterans in research. It describes a multi-pass approach to reading papers. The papers that you can choose to read may vary in difficulty, and we do not expect anyone to understand all of the content in the papers. Nonetheless, it is important to start building your ability to read research papers, especially research papers out of your comfort zone. The notation, mathematics, and jargon of the paper matter less than the big ideas and context of the paper. Read papers, take notes, and answer the questions for each paper individually (see below).



Questions for each paper：

- What are the papers’ main contributions? Describe the core idea.
- What was surprising, difficult, or confusing in the paper?
- Were the experiments (if there are any) convincing?
- How can these methods be applied in ways not described in the paper? Have you seen these ideas in other papers? Feel free to cite relevant work.
